/**
 * The wprover package provides core functionalities for geometric proving and constraint-based computations.
 * This package is designed with a clear separation of concerns. It encapsulates the core proving logic,
 * geometric drawing operations, and constraint verifications while isolating these functionalities from the
 * main user interface management. Classes such as DrawBase demonstrate this design by offering methods for
 * drawing geometric elements and handling interactions.
 * Note: Although the focus of this package is on the prover functionalities, some classes may include minimal
 * UI components solely to support interactive functionalities within the proving process.
