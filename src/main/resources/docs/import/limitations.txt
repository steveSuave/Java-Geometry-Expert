JGEX can import certain GeoGebra files with the following limitations:

Allowed GeoGebra objects:
points, segments, lines, circles.

Supported commands:
Polygon, Midpoint, Segment, Line, OrthogonalLine, LineBisector, Intersect, Circle,
Prove, ArePerpendicular, AreCollinear, AreCongruent.

Support for intersection of a line and a circle or two circles is incomplete.

Colors and other properties of the objects are ignored.

The Prove command is partially supported.
The following syntaxes are currently recognized:
* Prove(AreCollinear(A, B, C))
* Prove(AreConcyclic(A, B, C, D))
* Prove(AreParallel(f, g)) or Prove(f ∥ g)
* Prove(ArePerpendicular(f, g)) or Prove(f ⊥ g)
* Prove(AreCongruent(f, g)) or Prove(f ≟ g) or Prove(AB ≟ CD)
* Prove(P ≟ Q) or AreEqual(P,Q)
* Prove(P ∈ l)

There may be further limitations that are not documented here.
